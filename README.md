# HackNJIT_ProjectPyrates
Project for the 2023 Fall NJIT Hackathon

Pyrates is based on a data set provided by https://github.com/newzealandpaul/Maritime-Pirate-Attacks/tree/v1.0/data/csv.
There are 3 csv files in this data set: Country codes, country indicators and pirate attacks in the countries along with various different statistics.

Our project has 3 different tabs: Categorized Lists, Graphical Data and Attack Prediction Score.
